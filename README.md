# hippo8
The hippo8 is a custom 8-bit cisc breadboard computer built from scratch with discrete CMOS and TTL chips and components.
I also wrote a custom assembler to assemble the assembly code into the custom instruction set in binary.

# Acknowledgements
This project all started in 2021 when I discovered [Ben Eater's](https://github.com/beneater) 8-bit computer series on YouTube, so many thanks to him for starting it all.

Also I must give credit to the GOAT [DerULF1](https://github.com/DerULF1) for his incredible 8-bit computer build, of which my build is nearly a clone schematically. Much of the hippo8's hardware is based on his build, so many thanks as I practically studied his [YouTube series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5-Ar_CvItgaP27eT_C7MnCiubkyaEqF0&si=xrgBiyPQprl_dDX3) religiously.

Besides these two people, I also took inspiration, big and small, and learned much from many people over the years of whom I wish to credit below in no particular order...
- [jdh](https://github.com/jdah): for his video on his jdh-8 and [one hour long video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znxZBWAO2aU) that I watched many times
- [James Bates](https://github.com/jamesbates): for his videos on his [enhanced breadboard computer](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_i7PfWMNYobSPpg1_voiDe6qBcjvuVui&si=7Ig97iCZv4CPB4Ni)
- [Michael Kamprath](https://github.com/michaelkamprath): for his videos on his [PUTEY-1 computer](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC4jDTViU38EQzCYaRsoOLeGLLW5cMN4A&si=AIdiNpn_8qgJl1m7)
- Esperantanoso: for his videos on [DUO ADEPT](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL75A1967B78B0D5A4&si=6HdtZFb8D4EQIJP7) computer
- Bill Buzbee: for his [Magic-1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jRgpTp8pR8)
